# General

This is my personal site.

It contains a blog as well as other content.

Stack:
* Language: typescript
* Frontend: react, redux, router
* Backend: node, express
* Database: mongo

# Requirements

```bash
node
mongodb
```

# Start backend

```bash
cd server/
npm i
sudo npm i -g nodemon
BLOG_PASSWORD=<> nodemon app.js
```

The blog password is the acronym for your football app, and the YY that you developed it for.

# Start frontend

```bash
cd client
npm i
npm start
```
